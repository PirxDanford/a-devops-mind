# Introduction

Back when I was a Senior Developer and heard about DevOps for the first time it felt like "this is me, this is what I am doing" - at that time necessity dictated that I took over more and more "Operations" tasks, so I figured I could get a new job honoring my expertise. Since then over a year has passed and I am learning more and more things about DevOps at my new company. Most prominently that at every conference and every meetup it is being discussed what exactly this trend involves. Still after being around for over six years, there is still no clear answer to what exactly DevOps is about.

In the spirit of sharing I am writing this book completely openly and accessible for everyone. It will be accessible via many channels and using GitHub and GitBook you will even have direct access. Heck maybe some people will even contribute whole chapters. If only for the "glory" of having their name of choice being included as source for a contribution. Read the section about contributing for further details.
