# Contributing

There will be different types of contributions, as they evolve this page will get updated.

Besides using GitHub as outlined below you may also contact me via [E-Mail](mailto:pirxdanford@googlemail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemens-scholz/) or even on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PirxDanford).

## GitHub

This book project is linked with [https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/](https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/) and will automatically be kept synchronized. All mechanisms of GitHub are available, so you can fork the repository, open issues, create pull requests or write a Wiki page.

### Opening an Issue

Feel free to open an issue at [https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/issues](https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/issues) if you don't find a good template matching your issue type just open a regular issue. Just keep in mind that you have to provide your name if you want to be shown as contributor. If it is a huge amount of content I will certainly ask you about it, should you forget including your name.

### Creating a Pull Request

You have to be more familiar with GitHub to create a pull request, but this is a powerful tool. If you are new to this, start reading about forks here [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). After creating your fork and making the changes/additions you would like then read here [https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Naming you as contributor will be handled the same way as with pull request.

### Writing a Wiki Page

Alternatively you can just write a page here [https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/wiki](https://github.com/PirxDanford/a-devops-mind/wiki) again remember to include your name.

## Contributing Types

There are many ways in which you can contribute and I am thankful for any input!

### Silent Contributions

If you don't want to be mentioned, but have corrections or content you want to provide: Let me at least mention that it was an anonymous contribution. If even this is too much, then I will of course honor this.

### Typographic Corrections

As the title suggests this section is meant for copy editors, no matter how small the contribution is, every little correction helps in creating a smooth reading experience.

If provided via issue or pull request I will include a link alongside with the name.

### Content Corrections

This page is meant for those, who spotted logical or factual errors and helped mending them.

If provided via issue or pull request I will include a link alongside with the name.

### Stories or Chapters

This page will be a complete overview of whole stories and chapters which have been provided from third parties. Of course the names will already have been mentioned as source directly at the story or chapter in question. But a complete overview is convenient and there is never enough glory to be distributed!
