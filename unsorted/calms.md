# CALMS

In short, this "Framework" is being coined by some to superceed ITIL. I don't know about that, but I believe it is a great answer to what the DevOps idea is all about.

It stands for Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement and Sharing. Each of this topics deserves its own chapter and in my opinion CALMS will evolve to be the standard definition of the DevOps idea.
