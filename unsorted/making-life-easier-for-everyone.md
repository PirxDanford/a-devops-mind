# Making life easier for everyone

For me this is the simple answer of what DevOps is all about.

Detour: I have heard multiple times now that a company hiring a DevOps Engineer or even staffing a DevOps Department is "doing it wrong" and I kind of agree. But let's face the harsh reality. A company which is doing this, does not have enough knowledge to do it differently!

No matter if you have been hired as DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer or whatever title you have or which role you are filling in your company. If your life includes making everyones life easier you are very likely doing DevOps!

This is the simple answer, now read the chapter about CALMS to learn more about the more complex truth.
